# Every line of HTML you write from now on will be saved into this file.
# You are now ready to start creating your web page.
# All HTML documents start with the <!DOCTYPE> declaration.

# This line tells the web browser that the file contains HTML code. This is not an HTML tag.

# This line is specified as follows:

 

# Add the <head> and <body> elements

# Now that we’ve added the doctype, let’s begin adding the HTML code.

# An HTML file begins with the <html> tag and ends with the corresponding closing </html> tag. All HTML code will be placed within these two tags.

# The HTML document is divided up into two sections: a head and a body

# The <head> tag defines the metadata about the page, which is used by browsers and search engines.
# This information may include the document title, character set, styles to be used, scripts, etc.
# Contents of <head> section are not displayed to the user.

# The <body> tag defines the document body, and contains all the visible content like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, etc.

# The skeleton of an HTML document looks like this:

# Add the code below to your file, beneath your doctype declaration.

    <!DOCTYPE html>

# Insert the above code into the HTML file you created in the previous step.

# Your file should now look like this:
# Add a Paragraph

Now, let’s add a short description.

The tag <p> is used to define a paragraph.

In this example, we’ll add a few lines about Thomas J. Watson.

Add the below code after the <h1> heading .
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

  Add an Image

An <img> tag is used to add an image.

Let’s add an image of Thomas J. Watson after the heading.

To add an image you need to know the image file name and mention it in the ‘src’ attribute.

The ‘src’ attribute specifies an external resource that you want to link, such as the URL of an image.

You can optionally specify how many pixels the width and height of the image should be.

Type the below code after the <h1> heading .

  <!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Thomas J. Watson Sr -  Fan Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Thomas J. Watson </h1>
    <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7e/Thomas_J_Watson_Sr.jpg" width="300" height="300">

    <p>Thomas J. Watson, Sr. is the American industrialist, who built the International Business Machines Corporation (<a href="https://www.ibm.com">IBM</a>)  into the largest manufacturer of electric typewriters and data-processing equipment in the world.
